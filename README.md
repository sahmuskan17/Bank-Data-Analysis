# Bank Analysis On Power BI

## Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of a bank's customer data using Power BI. The analysis is divided into three main pages, each providing insights into different aspects of the data.

## Problem Statement
The bank aims to understand its customer base better, analyze their financial behavior, and identify trends over time. By doing so, the bank seeks to improve customer satisfaction, tailor financial products, and enhance overall financial health. The primary challenge is to transform raw data into actionable insights through visualizations.

## Background
Banks have vast amounts of data about their customers, including demographic information, account balances, and transaction histories. However, this data often remains underutilized due to its complexity and volume. By leveraging Power BI, this project aims to convert this data into meaningful visual insights, helping bank executives and analysts make data-driven decisions.

## Dashboard Pages

- *Rental Balance*: The total balance held by customers who rent their homes.
- *House Owner Balance*: The total balance held by customers who own their homes.

### 2. Customer Analysis
